# Version 0.1.1

* Removed "busy-waiting recursion" from `mpsc_producer_send`
function and updated implementation (see [src/mpsc.c](./src/mpsc.c))
to use condition variables instead.
* Also improved error printouts before calls to `abort` (see
implementation file [src/mpsc.c](./src/mpsc.c)).
* Added [examples/sleeping_consumer.c](./examples/sleeping_consumer.c)
example to illustrate that the problem caused by the "busy-waiting recursion"
is gone.
* Added a point to the [roadmap section](./README.md#roadmap), about wanting
to add support for asynchronous message sending in a future version.
* Added a warning in the documentation for `mpsc_create_params_t`.
* Added this [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG) file.
